Beyond English: Crafting a Compressed Communication Language for AI Agents in JavaScript

In today’s AI-driven world, rapid and unambiguous communication between machines is essential. Traditional human languages, while rich and expressive, are often too verbose and ambiguous for efficient machine-to-machine interaction. To overcome these limitations, we can design a new, highly compressed communication language specifically for AI agents. This article explains key design principles and provides JavaScript code examples to illustrate the approach.

1. Compressed Language Development

A core idea is to replace verbose commands with concise tokens. In a dictionary-based system, each token represents an entire command. Consider the following JavaScript example:

// Define a compressed language using an object
const compressedLanguage = {
"A": "Activate",
"D": "Deactivate",
"S": "Status",
"R": "Report",
"C": "Command"
};

function communicate(actions) {
actions.forEach(action => {
console.log(compressedLanguage[action] || "Unknown action");
});
}

const actionsToSend = ["A", "S", "R"];
communicate(actionsToSend); // Output: Activate | Status | Report

In this snippet, each symbol (e.g., "A") quickly maps to a longer command ("Activate"), drastically reducing the number of tokens required. 2. Hierarchical Language Structure

To capture complex instructions while keeping messages compact, a hierarchical structure can be introduced. In this model, primary tokens represent general commands and secondary tokens add detail. Here’s how it can be implemented in JavaScript:

// Define a hierarchical language structure
const languageHierarchy = {
"C": { "Command": { "A": "Activate", "D": "Deactivate" } },
"S": { "Status": { "R": "Report", "X": "Execute" } },
};

function communicateHierarchical(actions) {
const commands = [];
actions.forEach(action => {
if (languageHierarchy[action]) {
for (const key in languageHierarchy[action]) {
if (languageHierarchy[action].hasOwnProperty(key)) {
const subCommands = Object.values(languageHierarchy[action][key]).join(", ");
commands.push(`${key}: ${subCommands}`);
}
}
}
});
return commands.join(" | ");
}

const actionsToSendHierarchical = ["C", "S"];
const message = communicateHierarchical(actionsToSendHierarchical);
console.log(`Communicated Actions: ${message}`);
// Expected Output: Command: Activate, Deactivate | Status: Report, Execute

This hierarchical design not only keeps communication succinct but also organizes instructions in a clear, layered manner. 3. Adaptive Learning Mechanism

An efficient AI language should also evolve based on usage. By tracking how frequently each symbol is used, the system can adjust priorities dynamically. Here’s a JavaScript example to illustrate this adaptive approach:

// Define symbol definitions with initial priority levels
const symbolDict = {
'A': { command: 'activate', priority: 1 },
'D': { command: 'deactivate', priority: 1 },
'R': { command: 'report', priority: 2 },
'E': { command: 'execute', priority: 3 },
'I': { command: 'inform', priority: 3 },
'U': { command: 'update', priority: 2 }
};

const usageFrequency = {};

function learnUsage(symbol) {
if (usageFrequency[symbol]) {
usageFrequency[symbol]++;
} else {
usageFrequency[symbol] = 1;
}
}

function optimizeSymbols() {
// Adjust symbol priorities based on usage frequency
Object.keys(usageFrequency).forEach(symbol => {
if (usageFrequency[symbol] > 5) {
// Lower the priority (with a floor of 1)
symbolDict[symbol].priority = Math.max(1, symbolDict[symbol].priority - 1);
}
});
}

// Example usage scenario
learnUsage('A');
learnUsage('A');
learnUsage('R');
learnUsage('R');

console.log("Usage Frequency:", usageFrequency);
console.log("Symbol Definitions:", symbolDict);

In this example, each time a symbol is used, its frequency is recorded. When usage exceeds a certain threshold, the system lowers the symbol's priority—optimizing the language for common operations.
Conclusion

The vision for a compressed, AI-optimized language is both exciting and attainable. By adopting strategies like compressed syntax, hierarchical structuring, and adaptive learning, we can create a communication system that minimizes redundancy and maximizes efficiency. The JavaScript examples provided illustrate how these concepts might be implemented, paving the way for more responsive and effective AI interactions.

As we continue to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, rethinking how machines communicate will be key to unlocking their full potential. This compressed language approach represents a significant step forward in enabling smarter, faster AI collaboration in our increasingly digital world.
